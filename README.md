This project investigates how economic factors and specifically load factor affect cancellation in the US domestic flights. I have used the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics to get the cancellation and load factor data and the US National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration to get the precipitation data. There are some descritive statistics about these variables and how they are related to each other. Besides, in the Models and Analysis section, different Pooled OLS and Fixed Effects models have been used to figure out the relationship between load factor, cancellation and precipitation at origin and destination airports.Data cleaning, Prescriptive statistics and Models & Analysis have been implemented in Python, Python and R respectively.
